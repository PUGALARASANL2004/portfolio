SKILLS
PROJECTS
Vehicle Routing Problem Optimization using Genetic Algorithm                                                        [Feb 2025 – Mar 2025]
Implemented a Genetic Algorithm using the DEAP library to solve the Vehicle Routing Problem, optimizing delivery paths through crossover, mutation, and selection techniques.
Integrated logic from a Maze Solver to enhance shortest path discovery and computational efficiency.
Delivered a scalable solution that reduced the overall transportation cost by 30% and improved the delivery time.

Human Activity Recognition - Guided Project                                                                                     [Nov 2024 – Jan 2025]
Processed sensor data using PCA for dimensionality reduction and applied K-Means for unsupervised grouping.
Achieved 94% classification accuracy using Random Forest and SVM models with feature scaling and selection.
Improved the model’s robustness by performing hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and validating performance through cross-validation.

Credit Card Fraud Detection                                                                                                                  [Feb 2024 – Mar 2024]
Built a logistic regression model to classify fraudulent transactions from a real-world imbalanced dataset (~280K records), achieving 89.8% accuracy.
Developed a complete web app with Django (backend) and Streamlit (frontend) to enable real-time fraud prediction.
Enhanced fraud class detection through advanced data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation techniques.
